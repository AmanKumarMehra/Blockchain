## IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)
* It is a protocol and peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data in a distributed file system.
* IPFS – is just a network protocol like HTTP. It helps you to transfer data across the web servers as just like HTTP.  But the difference here is, it transfer the data’s through peer-to-peer decentralized network.  

* In simple HTTP is a request-response protocol.  If you are using internet means you will be consider as a client, and if you are requesting to see a web page then this activity will be sent as request to the server which serves the data.  The server sends data in response to the request.

* Http is a location based protocol, so whenever a request sent from client, it will be transferred in to an IP address on google server. And the server will start responding to the request.

### Drawbacks Of HTTP
* Occurrence of slow response (Due to large traffic).
* Occurrence of not getting response -> If there is any problem in network service line, or if  the content deleted from that location

### How IPFS can replace HTTP and how does it works?
* A http request will be sent like this : http://12.43.323.24/location/file.txt

* Where as a IPFS request will be sent like this : ipfs/Ewers43TvaT4345/location/file.txt

 

* http passes the address of the file, and where as the ipfs passes the cryptographic hashcode to address the content. 
* This hash code represents the root object and the other objects found in the path.
* http sends request to the server, but whereas the ipfs access the data from the nearest node.

## Layers in Blockchain

### Blockchain Trilemma

* Scalability
* Secure
* Decentralize

### CAP Theorem
 
* Any blockchain can acheicve maximum two feature of Blockchain Trilemma

### Layers in Blockchain
Layer0
* Allow Blockchins to entract with each other
* Faster and cheaper transaction
* Infrastructure for developers --> If any developer wants to add any new functionality
* Includes Internet, Hardware and connections

Layer1
* Security
* Example - Proof of work(Bitcoin) / Proof of Stack(Ethereum)

Layer2
* Scalability - defines time it takes for 1 transaction. 
* Ploygon uses Layer2 which makes it faster than bitcoin and ethereum
* Bitcoin Lightning Network - it Uses Payment Channel

Layer3
* UI Interface
